## Semantic Versioning

This project uses Semantic Versioning through PBR. This means when you make a commit you can add a message like:

`Sem-Ver: feature - Added this functionality that does blah.`

Then the version will automatically get bumped in the right way when releasing the package.

More info about how to use the Semantic Versioning through PBR: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/pbr/#version
