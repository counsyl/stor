------

* Ensure OBSFile cleans itself up (commits to remote / deletes local buffer /
  etc) even when not used in ``with`` statement.

v1.3.0
------
* When deleting a swift container, also attempt to delete
  ``$CONTAINER+segments``, which is the format that SwiftStack's S3 emulation

  ``copytree``, ``list`` to work on folders that contain broken symlinks.

------

* Added .travis.yml for testing against Python 2 and 3
* Added additional coverage to get to 100%
